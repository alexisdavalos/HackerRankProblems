When the Word Input has a non-empty value and the Append Button is clicked, the Word Input is emptied so its value becomes "". Additionally, the word typed in the input must appear in the content of Text Field as the last word, where the content of the Text Field consists of all typed words that have not been undone, joined by a single space character.

 

When the Undo Button is clicked, the last appended and not already undone word from the content of the Text Field is removed (along with the space character preceding it if it exists).
